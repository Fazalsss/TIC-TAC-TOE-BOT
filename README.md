## TIC TAC TOE BOT
In this project I developed a strategic game-bot with an advanced algorithm designed to excel in Tic Tac Toe, employing artificial intelligence techniques. The bot is programmed to win or draw in nearly all game scenarios. Integrated a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter for enhanced interaction.


## Features

**Strategic Game-bot:** Developed a sophisticated algorithm using the minimax algorithm to provide an effective opponent in Tic-Tac-Toe, capable of winning in most scenarios.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Integrated Tkinter library to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.

## Techniques and Skills:

1. ****Python Programming:**** Entirely written in Python, leveraging its object-oriented features to structure the game logic.

2. **Minimax Algorithm:** Implemented a recursive minimax function (minimax()) to determine the optimal move for the bot.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Used classes (TicTacToe) and methods (print_board(), play_game()) to organize and manage the game state.

4. **GUI Development:** Utilized Tkinter for designing and implementing the graphical user interface (play_game() method displays the board and handles user clicks).


## To run the Tic-Tac-Toe Bot:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine. Verify with python --version in your terminal/command prompt.

2. Clone or download the repository containing the Python file (tictactoe.py).

3. Navigate to the directory with the Python file in your terminal/command prompt.

4. Execute the Python file with python tictactoe.py.

5. Play against the Tic-Tac-Toe bot through the graphical user interface.
